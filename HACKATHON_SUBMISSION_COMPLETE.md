## üåü Inspiration

The challenge of finding relevant information in massive document repositories is ubiquitous across industries. Traditional keyword search often fails to capture semantic meaning, while pure AI generation can hallucinate facts. We were inspired to create a solution that combines the precision of Elasticsearch's hybrid search with the intelligence of Google's Vertex AI.

Our inspiration came from watching knowledge workers spend hours sifting through documents, legal professionals struggling with case law research, and researchers overwhelmed by academic papers. We envisioned an AI concierge that doesn't just search‚Äîit understands, contextualizes, and provides intelligent assistance across any document collection.

## üöÄ What it does

Elastic Context Concierge is an intelligent document assistant that revolutionizes how users interact with large document repositories. It combines:
